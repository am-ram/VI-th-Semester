Good afternoon one and all ...we are group 2 and our project is a Panic Alarm.
This is a device that is exclusively designed for the elderly people but can also be used
by anyone. It alerts the dependents when the user is in danger & it is not just that it
alerts when someone presses the button but it is also capable of automatically alerting
in case of emergency.
We have already seen the intuition and circuit design of the model in the review 1 and 
now I would like to show you the connections in brief and then we would be moving to
the code explanation and then the live demo of the working. As u can see here in the 
slide we have the following components. A pulse sensor for monitoring the pulse,
an LED for indicating the status of the model, A node mcu that deals with the connection
to the hotspot, jumper wires for connecting the components, a bread board and a push
button that is used in cases of emergency.
Now we are going to move to discussing the code that drives this model and sends the
alerts to the e-mail and also to the dashboard of the webapp.
The code will be discussed by shaiq.
